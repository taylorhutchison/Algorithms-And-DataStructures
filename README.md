# Algorithms and Data Structures

This project demonstrates some fundamental Computer Science concepts. The project is written in C# and is setup to use .NET Core. There are two libraries (Structures and Algorithms) and a Test directory.

## Concepts Implemented To Date: 
### Algorithms:

### Data Structures:
 - Singly Linked List
    - LinkedList&lt;T&gt;
    - DoubleLinkedList&lt;T&gt;
 - Doubly Linked List
 - Stack
    - Stack&lt;T&gt; (Implemented With Array)
 - Queue
    - Queue&lt;T&gt; (Implemented with Array)
    - LinkedListQueue&lt;T&gt; (Implemented with a Linked List)
    - PriorityQueue &lt;T&gt; (Implemented with a Linked List)

## Instructions to run the tests:
1. Install .NET Core for your platform: [https://www.microsoft.com/net/core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)
2. Open the command line.
3. git clone https://github.com/taylorhutchison/Algorithms-And-DataStructures.git
4. cd Algorithms-And-DataStructures
5. ./build.sh
6. dotnet test Tests
